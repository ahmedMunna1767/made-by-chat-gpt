# Difference Between Different Versions Of Uuid

UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) can be generated using different versions of the UUID algorithm, each with a different format and characteristics. The five versions of UUID are:

1. Version 1: This algorithm uses the current time and the MAC address of the machine generating the UUID to create a unique identifier. The first 60 bits of the UUID represent the timestamp, while the remaining bits represent the node identifier.

2. Version 2: This algorithm is similar to version 1, but includes an additional "local domain" identifier to distinguish between different namespaces. Version 2 UUIDs are rarely used and not widely supported.

3. Version 3: This algorithm uses a namespace identifier and a name string to generate a unique identifier. The namespace identifier can be a UUID or a URL, while the name string is typically a domain-specific name or identifier. The resulting UUID is deterministic and unique for a given namespace and name.

4. Version 4: This algorithm generates a random UUID using a cryptographically secure random number generator. The probability of generating two identical UUIDs is extremely low, but not zero.

5. Version 5: This algorithm is similar to version 3, but uses a SHA-1 hash function instead of MD5. The resulting UUID is also deterministic and unique for a given namespace and name.

The main differences between the different versions of UUID are the algorithm used to generate the UUID, the format of the UUID, and the characteristics of the UUID, such as whether it is deterministic or random. It is important to note that all versions of UUID are designed to be globally unique, and can be used in a variety of applications where unique identifiers are required.
