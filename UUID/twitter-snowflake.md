# Twitter Snowflake Id

Twitter Snowflake is a unique ID generation system used by Twitter to generate IDs for tweets, users, and other objects within their system. Snowflake IDs are 64-bit integers that are composed of a timestamp, a unique node identifier, and a sequence number.

The Snowflake ID generation system was designed to be highly scalable and able to generate IDs at a high rate with low latency. Each Snowflake ID contains the following components:

1. Timestamp: A 41-bit timestamp with millisecond precision, which allows for IDs to be sorted in time order.
2. Node identifier: A 10-bit identifier that represents the machine or process generating the ID.
3. Sequence number: A 12-bit sequence number, which is incremented for each ID generated within the same millisecond and node ID combination.

By combining these components, Snowflake IDs are guaranteed to be unique and sortable in time order, which makes them useful for distributed systems and data processing pipelines.
