# Database Sequence as ID Pitfalls

Using database sequences for generating primary keys can have scalability and high availability limitations in distributed systems because:

1. Centralization: Database sequences rely on a centralized database to generate unique IDs, which can become a bottleneck in systems with a large number of transactions or a high rate of ID generation. In distributed systems, this centralization can become a single point of failure, resulting in downtime and lost transactions.

2. Coordination: In a distributed system, multiple nodes may need to generate unique IDs simultaneously, requiring coordination to prevent the generation of duplicate IDs. This coordination can add complexity and reduce performance, particularly in systems with high transaction rates.

3. Performance: Generating IDs using database sequences can be slower than other techniques such as UUIDs, particularly in high-concurrency systems. This can become a performance bottleneck and limit the scalability of the system.

4. Scalability: As the number of nodes in a distributed system grows, the scalability of a centralized database sequence may become limited due to the need for coordination and synchronization.

5. High availability: In distributed systems, ensuring high availability of a centralized database sequence can be challenging, particularly in the event of a network failure or other outage.

To address these limitations, alternative techniques such as UUIDs or Twitter Snowflake IDs can be used for generating primary keys in distributed systems. These techniques offer more scalability and better high availability by generating IDs that are globally unique without relying on a centralized database.
