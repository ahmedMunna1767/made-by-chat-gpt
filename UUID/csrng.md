# Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator

A cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG) is a type of random number generator that generates random numbers in a way that makes them suitable for use in cryptographic applications.

In cryptography, random numbers are used to create encryption keys, to generate initialization vectors for block ciphers, and to create nonces for cryptographic protocols. A cryptographically secure random number generator ensures that the random numbers used in these applications are truly random, and that they cannot be predicted or reproduced by an attacker.

A CSRNG achieves this by using a combination of techniques, such as collecting random data from physical sources (such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay), using mathematical algorithms to generate pseudorandom data, and applying cryptographic techniques to ensure that the generated numbers are unpredictable and statistically random.

The use of a cryptographically secure random number generator is essential for maintaining the security of cryptographic systems. If a random number generator is not cryptographically secure, an attacker may be able to predict the numbers used in a cryptographic system, which can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
