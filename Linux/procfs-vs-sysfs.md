# PROCFS & SYSFS

Procfs and sysfs are both virtual file systems that provide interfaces to kernel data structures and system information in Linux-based operating systems. While they serve similar purposes, there are some differences between the two:

1. Purpose and Focus:
   - Procfs (Process File System): It primarily exposes information about running processes and their attributes. It provides a structured interface to access details such as process IDs, memory usage, file descriptors, command-line arguments, and more.
   - Sysfs (System File System): It focuses on providing information about various devices, drivers, and their configurations. It exposes a hierarchical representation of the system's physical and logical devices, including buses, storage, CPU, network interfaces, and more.

2. File Structure:
   - Procfs: It presents a flat view of the processes running on the system. Each process is represented by a numbered directory, and files within those directories contain process-specific information.
   - Sysfs: It provides a hierarchical structure representing devices and drivers. Each device is represented by a directory, and attributes related to that device are exposed as files within those directories.

3. Persistence:
   - Procfs: It is a transient file system that exists only in memory and is dynamically generated by the kernel when accessed. The data in procfs reflects the current state of the system and is not persisted across reboots.
   - Sysfs: It is a persistent file system that is usually mounted on the `/sys` directory. The data in sysfs represents the current configuration and state of devices and drivers. It is populated during system boot and remains available even after a reboot.

4. Accessible Information:
   - Procfs: It provides detailed information about processes, such as process status, memory usage, CPU utilization, and other process-specific attributes.
   - Sysfs: It exposes information about devices, drivers, and their configurations. This includes device-specific details, device capabilities, driver parameters, and other relevant data.

In summary, procfs primarily focuses on processes and their attributes, while sysfs focuses on devices, drivers, and their configurations. Procfs offers a flat view of processes, while sysfs provides a hierarchical representation of devices. Procfs is transient and reflects the current state of the system, whereas sysfs is persistent and represents the system's device configuration.
